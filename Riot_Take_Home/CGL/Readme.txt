This was my quick and dirt solotion

I was thinking of Trie ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie ) to save space, but I am sure there are better ways of storing to make ir save space and do quick lookup. KD Tree or Octree layer ontop of a Trie was another thing I thought about, but I didnt really have the time.

From what the recrutter tole me

The main point of the excercise is to see what you can do in a short time (3 hours) and then in the interview explain your thinking in the code, discusss what could have been better. Its to get the conversation going.
